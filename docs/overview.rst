Particle Home
=============

A web interface for getting and sending data to `Particle <https://store.particle.io>`_ devices. Focusing on simplicity, I am referencing pertinent information.

`Bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com>`_ for styling

`Vue <https://vuejs.org>`_ for updating data without reloading

`Particle JS API <https://docs.particle.io/reference/SDKs/javascript/>`_ for communication to your devices 

Google sheets for data storage
